The speed limit governor is a droop governor where the speed limit value defines the speed at the maximum torque available during this operation.\r\n\r\nIf a device wants to know whether it has access to the engine, there are several possibilities:\r\n\r\na. Comparing its command with the actual engine broadcasts.\r\nb. Looking at command modes from other devices.\r\nc. Looking to the engine and retarder torque mode.\r\n\r\nRemarks:\r\n\r\na. The realization of a torque limit (minimum selection) is possible by setting the speed limit to a high value (0xFAFF).\r\nb. The realization of a speed limit (minimum selection) is possible by setting the torque limit to a high value (0xFA).\r\nc. Limiting the retarder torque means to limit the magnitude of the torque request.  As the brake torque is represented by negative torque values, the limitation must be done by a maximum selection of the requested torque and the retarder internal torque signals.\r\nd. For torque increasing functions, time limits for the torque or speed value (command) and the direct modes are desirable.\r\n\r\ne. The selection of which device has control of the engine's speed or torque depends on the override mode priority (see SPN 897) with the highest priority device gaining control.  In the case of two devices with identical priority, the engine responds to speed/torque control commands over speed/torque limit commands and will act on the speed or torque commands on a first come, first served basis.  The torque limit will be a “lowest wins” selection (e.g., if one device commands 60% limit and another 80% limit, then the engine will limit torque to 60%).  Figure SPN695_A provides a flowchart of the torque/speed control priority selection logic.","Data Range":"0 to 3","Operational Range":"","Resolution":"4 states/2 bit","Offset":"0","Units":"bit","Date SPN was added to PGN":"1-Oct-98","Status of SPN addition to PGN":"Published","Date SPN was added/modified":"11/30/03","Status of SPN":"Published","SPN Doc":"J1939-71"},{"PGN Doc":"J1939-71","PGN":"0","Parameter Group Label":"Torque/Speed Control 1","PGN Length":"8","Transmission Rate":"to engine: Control Purpose dependent or 10 ms\nto retarder: 50 ms","Acronym":"TSC1","pos":"1.3","SPN length":"2","SPN":"696","Name":"Engine Requested Speed Control Conditions","Description":"This mode tells the engine control system the governor characteristics that are desired during speed control.

It is possible that the shift selector software may not know the number of forward ranges.  The shift selector may identify the position selected by the operator while the transmission ECU determines what range or gear that represents.  If there is a digital display, the transmission ECU would communicate what is to be displayed via another message such as ETC#2 or ETC#7.\r\n\r\nFor example:  Consider a vehicle with a 5-speed automatic transmission with the shift lever on the column. Suppose that shift selector has a limited number of positions, such that having positions for D-4-3-2-1 is not an option. For this example, assume there are only have enough lever positions for D-3-2-1. Pulling the lever into \"D\" will put the transmission in 5th (highest gear).  It is desired that pulling the lever to the physical “3” position will limit the transmission to a maximum range of 3rd gear.\r\n\r\nWhen the selector is pulled down into \"3\", the shifter selector itself has no way of correlating this physical lever position to the desired gear; it would have to be calibrated with software to tell it this information. If not calibrated, the shift selector cannot directly command the transmission to go to 3rd gear; it only knows it's one notch below drive.\r\n\r\nHowever, if \"D-1\" (lever position, as opposed to desired gear) is broadcast by the selector, the transmission ECU can receive this and then make the determination of what range is desired. The benefit is that no specific calibration of the shift selector is required. \r\n\r\nBetween selector positions (0xEE to 0xE2) – Indicates the shift selector is not in an appropriate position.  If a lever-type shift selector with a mechanical display is stuck between detents, it may appear to the operator that it is in the desired position when in fact it is not. The shift selector may be capable of reporting only that it is between positions or that it is between forward or reverse positions. If known, the transmission ECU may respond differently depending on which positions are involved.\r\n\r\nReselect current position (0xE1) - If the TC1 message continues to send the position last selected, then a capability to reselect the same position is required.  For example:  If a ‘Neutral to Drive’ shift is selected and that shift is inhibited (say for high engine speed), it may be necessary for the operator to reselect ‘Drive’ after the inhibit conditions pass in order for the transmission ECU to honor the request.\r\n\r\nPosition unknown and/or no buttons pressed (0xE0) - A push-button style shift selector with momentary contact buttons may send this indicator after initialization before any buttons are pressed, or before the transmission ECU determines and communicates the initial selection.  This indicator could also be sent between button presses as an alternative to sending the last button press.","Data Range":"-125 to 125","Operational Range":"-64 to 64","Resolution":"1 gear value/bit","Offset":"-125","Units":"gear value","Date SPN was added to PGN":"9-Nov-00","Status of SPN addition to PGN":"Published","Date SPN was added/modified":"11/20/03","Status of SPN":"Published","SPN Doc":"J1939-71"},{"PGN Doc":"J1939-71","PGN":"256","Parameter Group Label":"Transmission Control 1","PGN Length":"8","Transmission Rate":"when active; 50 ms to transmission and axles","Acronym":"TC1","pos":"4.1","SPN length":"2","SPN":"685","Name":"Disengage Differential Lock Request - Front Axle 1","Description":"Command signal used to disengage the various differential locks, e.g., to allow an undistributed individual wheel control by ABS.

Activation of the foundation brakes after a time if retarder performance is insufficient\r\ny % - Faster activation of foundation brakes to compensate retarder performance, linear interpolation between 0 and  100%\r\n100% - Low retarder dynamics shall be fully compensated by the foundation brakes\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- This parameter has only an effect if XBR EBI switch is set to \"10: endurance brake integration allowed\"\r\n- XBR urgency makes sense only if the XBR request(s) is (are) processed in one device like the EBS controller which also sends TSC1 to the retarder(s). Such a data flow diagram is shown in figure PGN1024_A. When the Retarder is controlled directly by the XBR transmitter XBR urgency should be set to not available.\r\n\r\nIn adaptive cruise control (ACC) operation there are situations where it is useful to have as less lining wear as possible like keeping the set speed on going downhill. It would not be useful to activate foundation brakes in such a situation except when the capabilities of the endurance brakes are not sufficient.\r\n \r\nIn other situations like emergency braking or fast reaction on a car that cut in at a short distance in front of the own vehicle a reaction as fast as possible is needed. In such cases low retarder dynamics must be compensated by the foundation brakes.\r\n\r\nThere are two different ways to integrate the endurance brakes into the adaptive cruise control.\r\na) the request for deceleration could be processed by the EBS system completely. This means that the EBS receives the deceleration demand and activates the friction and/or the endurance brakes accordingly. EBS is sending the TSC1 to the retarder. (see figure PGN1024_A dataflow diagram for external brake request)\r\nb) the ACC sends XBR to the brake controller and TSC1 to the endurance brakes.\r\n\r\nIn case \"a)\" the ACC system does not have direct control of the endurance brakes. To adjust the endurance brakes according to the traffic situation (high or low urgency values see above) this new SPN is needed.\r\n\r\nIf the retarder performance is not sufficient (e.g. because of high retarder temperature) the foundation brakes will be added automatically. This case of not sufficient retarder performance cannot be covered by switching EBI mode from 01 (endurance brakes only) to EBI mode 10 (endurance brake integration allowed) because the actual deceleration caused by the retarder is less than the requested decelleration. A simple switching (01 to 10) would cause an uncomfortable jerk.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE:  This parameter is defined in European patent EP 1 386 774 B1 (see reference in section 2.1.3) and is included with permission from the patent holder.

If communication is lost during torque limited operation, unrestricted engine torque output could harm the transmission.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended that engines use reception of the ETC#1 message as a transmission “heartbeat”.  In the event that the ETC#1 message is not received in a time period of 5 times its’ broadcast rate (5 x 10 ms = 50 ms), the engine should invoke a torque limit holding the engine to less than or equal to the value of the Transmission Torque Limit parameter.  The engine may release the limit when transmission-to-engine communication is re-established.\r\n\r\nA value of 0xFF00 to 0xFFFF indicates that no transmission torque limit is desired.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that the engine will record this torque value in non-volatile memory and will include this in the engine configuration PGN as parameter Engine Default Torque Limit (SPN 1846)\r\n\r\nIf the engine observes change in this parameter value on power-up, the engine should record the new value.","Data Range":"0 to 64,255 Nm","Operational Range":"","Resolution":"1

Mode","Description":"This parameter is used to indicate the current state, or mode, of operation by the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) device. The states characterize independent system states (e.g., it is not possible to express distance control active and overtake mode simultaneously). ACC must not switch itself off while active because the driver expects it to work. So if an error occurs, the ACC must signal that to the driver so that the driver knows that he has to switch off the ACC.\r\n\r\n000 Off (Standby, enabled, ready for activation)\r\n001 Speed control active\r\n010 Distance control active\r\n011 Overtake mode\r\n100 Hold mode\r\n101 Finish mode\r\n110 Disabled or error condition\r\n111 Not available/not valid\r\n\r\n000b - Off—Used to indicate the ACC is enabled in calibration or configuration and there are no faults that would prevent the system from operating.\r\n001b - Speed Control Active—Used to indicate that ACC is on but not currently sending control messages.  In other words, there is no target ahead and regular vehicle cruise control is controlling the vehicle speed to the driver’s set speed.\r\n010b - Distance Control Active—Used to indicate that ACC is on and actively sending control messages to maintain the appropriate following interval.\r\n011b - Overtake Mode—Used to indicate that ACC is on but temporarily disabled because the driver is manually overriding cruise control by using either the accelerator pedal or the cruise control “accel” switch.\r\n100b - Hold Mode—Used to indicate that the ACC has lost the previous target vehicle and is in HOLD mode. In this mode, the ACC shall limit the speed to the speed held when the target was lost. For example,  if the driver activates the typical cruise buttons (Resume/Inc/Dec) the HOLD mode shall be exited and normal cruise functionality resumed. If a new target is detected, the Distance Control Active mode (010b) is again entered, unless existing conditions prohibit this.\r\n101b - Finish Mode—Used to indicate that ACC is on with no target ahead, and ACC is currently sending control messages to return to the driver’s set speed. This occurs when the target the ACC system was tracking moves out of the way so ACC returns the vehicle to the driver’s set speed.\r\n110b - Disabled or Error Condition—Used to indicate that ACC is in an error state and can not operate.","Data Range":"0 to 7","Operational Range":"","Resolution":"8 states/3 bit","Offset":"0","Units":"bit","Date SPN was added to PGN":"1-Oct-98","Status of SPN addition to PGN":"Published","Date SPN was added/modified":"12/31/01","Status of SPN":"Published","SPN Doc":"J1939-71"},{"PGN Doc":"J1939-71","PGN":"65135","Parameter Group Label":"Adaptive Cruise Control","PGN Length":"8","Transmission Rate":"100 ms","Acronym":"ACC1","pos":"4.4","SPN length":"3","SPN":"1589","Name":"Adaptive cruise control set distance mode","Description":"Selected distance mode for adaptive cruise control. \r\n\r\n000 ACC Distance mode #1 (largest distance)\r\n001 ACC Distance mode #2\r\n010 ACC Distance mode #3\r\n011 ACC Distance mode #4\r\n100 ACC Distance mode #5 (shortest distance)\r\n101 Conventional cruise control mode\r\n110 Error condition\r\n111 Not available/not valid","Data Range":"0 to 7","Operational Range":"","Resolution":"8 states/3 bit","Offset":"0","Units":"bit","Date SPN was added to PGN":"1-Oct-98","Status of SPN addition to PGN":"Published","Date SPN was added/modified":"7/1/98","Status of SPN":"Published","SPN Doc":"J1939-71"},{"PGN Doc":"J1939-71","PGN":"65135","Parameter Group Label":"Adaptive Cruise Control","PGN Length":"8","Transmission Rate":"100 ms","Acronym":"ACC1","pos":"5-6","SPN length":"16","SPN":"1591","Name":"Road curvature","Description":"Estimated value of the current road curvature for use by the adaptive cruise control system.

This “echo” parameter provides confirmation to the transmission that the engine has received and will invoke the requested Transmission Torque Limit in the event that J1939 communication is lost between the two devices.\r\n\r\nIf the engine supports this protection logic, the Engine Default Torque Limit parameter should be set equal to the Transmission Torque Limit parameter as received in the Transmission Configuration 2 message (PGN 65099).  Otherwise, an Engine Default Torque Limit value of FF00 to FFFF indicates that no engine default torque limit has been received or set.\r\n\r\nThe intention is to protect transmissions that use a continuous torque limit during torque converter mode or operation in specific lower gears, where stall or drivetrain torque may reach levels higher than the gearbox capacity.  If communication is lost during torque limited operation, unrestricted engine torque output could harm the transmission.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended that engines use reception of the ETC#1 message as a transmission “heartbeat”.  In the event that the ETC#1 message is not received in a time period of 5 times its’ broadcast rate (5 x 10 ms = 50 ms), the engine should invoke a torque limit holding the engine to less than or equal to the value of the Transmission Torque Limit parameter.
